# Project Statistical Modelling with Python

## Project/Goals
```
The goal for the project is to further my python skills mainly in importing/extracting through EDA from APIs and transforming this data into a regression model to see relations between variables.
```

## Process
```
1. Loading in the City Bikes API to select chosen city of Paris showing all availabe bike stations in the area
2. Loading in the Foursquare and Yelp APIs to connect their points of interest (POTs) to my city bikes information 
3. Merging city bikes table with Foursquare and Yelp table to see further information of the all related bike stations
4. Importing merged data to create a linear regression model where I only kept relevant variables in the model 
```

## Results
```
When comparing the Foursquare and Yelp APIs it was easy to notice the variety of different information the Yelp API provided such as price, ratings, and review counts for the POIs. However, the Yelp API included places from around Paris while Foursquare was strcitly Paris only which is better. All in all, the Yelp API was better than the Foursquare API.
```

## Challenges 
```
Biggest challenge was creating the loops to incorporate the city bikes data and new data from the APIs. I also found it difficult to merge the tables together which included alot of trial and error.
```

## Future Goals
```
With the time constraint it would've been nice to get a deeper understanding of the data and especially the regression model. I also would've liked to understand all the code that I wrote as sum of it was very confusing when I was incorporting it from my notes.
